## PHP/ColdFusion/GAE(Python)-based image editor ##

**DESCRIPTION**<br>
This is a browser-based image editor that was originally developed in 2004 for a content management system.  In December 2006, the code was cleaned up and the PHP version was released under LGPL on my former blog, AjaxProgrammer.com. Since then, it has been enhanced by various developers, integrated into many websites and projects, and ported to ColdFusion 7 and App Engine (Python).  In October 2009, the project made its way here, where it can live out its life cycle happily in the cloud.  I hope you find it useful and/or educational.<br>
